* Windows Developer Mode: Windows Settings > Update & Security > For developers, choose the Developer mode option.

## Projects in Win32WithBackgroundTask.sln

* **BackgroundTaskComponent**: WinRT C++ Background Task 
* **ConsoleRegisterBackgroundTask**: WinRT C++ Console app that registers the Background Task
* **Win32WithBackgroundTask.Package**: An Windows Application Packaging project. This is needed to deploy the app and register the background task with the OS.
* **UWPHead**: An empty UWP App. This is needed to properly populate the Appxmanifest.xml in the packaging project and ensure the MSIX package contains all of the required assemblies and files - functionally it doesn't do anything. 

```
Note: You will see the UWPHead app is also deployed when debugging from Visual Studio, however it is not included in the app package when distributing the app.
